# Cody's Interactive 3D Portfolio - New Technologies (to me)

**[IN PROGRESS]** My interactive threejs personal portfolio built with **Next.js**, featuring a real-time 3D avatar rendered using **Three.js**. Custom 3D models were created in **Blender** and brought to life with **react-three-fiber**.

- **Three.js** via `@react-three/fiber` – For rendering interactive 3D scenes
